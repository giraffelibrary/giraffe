 * The functor Closure constructs a closure instance given the type of the
 * called function arguments and the return value.  The type `t` is abstract
 * due to opaque signature matching to ensure that values from different
 * instances cannot be mixed.  Internally the type `t` is representated using
 * a pointer (though the value held may not actually be a meaningful address)
 * to allow a closure value to be used with GLib as the 'user data' parameter
 * whose C type is gpointer.
